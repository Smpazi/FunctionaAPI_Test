TASK

Functional API Test
This involves setting up a functional test against a web API. You can use any tool you
see fit for the task, if you are not sure which tool to use you should or do not have
access to one, you should write about how you would go about it in as much detail as
possible. It is expected that this could be completed within 30 mins.

Test Case
URL: https://www.kurtosys.com
• Add an assertion that the response status received was “200”
• Add an assertion to ensure that the response time is less than 2 seconds
• Add an assertion for the server header having a value of Cloudflare

How to run

1. Open terminal
2. Ensure the project directory is correctly shown and the environment is activated.
3. You run the tests by navigating to the project directory
4. Run pytest --html=report.html --self-contained-html
4. The command will run pytest test cases that are written under tests package.
5. You may not run the command as I have already generated the report.html, you can view the results using any browser

Project Structure
1. Page Object Model design is used
2. On the "src" package I keep Pages that will summarise API interactions like base url, GET, POST, PUT or DELETE calls
3. All test cases are created on "tests" packages
